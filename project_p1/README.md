# 1st project laboratory - Computer Graphics

**Final grade**: 5.5/6.0

## Improvement points

1. onRezise function wasn't implemented: it may be impossible due to the fact that camera views are being set with a fixed aspect instead of screen width/height;
2. construction functions for objects are too specific and break OO principles, some have too many arguments and end up difficulting reading the code;

## Project and commands
The purpose of this first project was to get acquainted with Three.js by creating a scene with a table, lamp and moving chair with 3 fixed cameras (top, lateral, front).

You can switch between the 3 cameras by pressing `1`, `2` and `3`. You can move the chair around using the `arrow keys`.
