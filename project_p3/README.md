**Final grade**: 5.0/5.0

## Project and commands
The purpose of this project was to develop an airplane in order to work with meshes, materials and lights. The scene contains
an airplane in the center and 4 different light cones in the corners.

You can turn on/off each cone individually by pressing `1`, `2`, `3` and `4`. The `arrow keys` rotate the airplane
on its own axis. `N` turns the directional light on and off. `L` turns on the illumination calculations. `G` switches 
between Gourard and Phong shadowing. `A` fills the mesh.
